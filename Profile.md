Areas of interest: Biochemistry, Microbiology, Molecular Biology, Biotechnology, and Bioinformatics
Research interests: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and using microbial genomic approaches to define the epidemiology and multidrug resistance risks of 
target bacterial pathogens. Provides novel solutions to combat antibiotic resistance using naturally derived bacteriophages. My Master's project focuses on isolating candidate 
bacteriophages against multidrug-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium from environmental sources in Kenya.
