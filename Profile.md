# Areas of interest: _Biochemistry, Microbiology, Molecular Biology, Biotechnology, and Bioinformatics_
## Research interests:
_* Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and using microbial genomic approaches to define the epidemiology and multidrug resistance risks of_ 
_target bacterial pathogens_. Provides novel solutions to combat antibiotic resistance using naturally derived bacteriophages. **_My Master's_** _**project**_ focuses on isolating candidate 
bacteriophages against multidrug-resistant _Enterococcus faecalis_ and _Enterococcus faecium_ from environmental sources in **Kenya**.
